# Sublime Rust

A high-performance, modern text editor inspired by Sublime Text, rewritten from the ground up in Rust using the GPUI framework.

## Project Goals

- **Performance:** Leveraging Rust's safety and speed.
- **Minimalism:** Maintaining the clean, focused interface of Sublime Text.
- **Extensibility:** Built with a modular architecture for easy customization.
- **Modern UI:** Using GPUI (the engine behind Zed) for smooth, GPU-accelerated rendering.

## Getting Started
